Duolingo used to have a convenient button to click to practice your language skills. But sadly, this button no longer exists.

Until now...

Introducing a chrome extension to bring back the Duolingo practice button!

This extension places a button on your home path screen that you can click to take you to a Duolingo practice session.

Look for Duolingo Practice Button on the Chrome Web Store
